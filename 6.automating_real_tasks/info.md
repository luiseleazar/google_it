# Info

## Web Application

It's an application that you interact with over HTTP.

## Data Serialization

The process of taking an in-memory data structure and turning into something that can be stored on disk or transmitted across a network.

## Deserialization

## JSON

## GET Method

 Retrieves or gets the resource specified in the URL. By sending a GET request to the web server, youâ€™re asking for the server to GET the resource for you.

## POST Method

This method sends, or posts, data to a web service. Whenever you fill a web form and press a button to submit, you're using the POST method to send that data back to the web server.

## Web Framework

A full-stack web framework handles a bunch of different components that are typical when creating a web application. It contains libraries that help you handle each of the pieces: writing your application's code, storing and retrieving data, receiving web requests, and responding to them.
Web frameworks are commonly split into three basic components: (1) the application code, where you'll add all of your application's logic; (2) the data storage, where you'll configure what data you want to store and how you're storing it; and (3) the web server, where you'll state which pages are served by which logic.

## MIME

Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) standard is used to encode all sorts of files as text strings that ca be sent via email. In order for the recipient of your message to understand what to do with an attachment, you need to label the attachment with MIME type and subtype to tell them what sort of file you're using.
