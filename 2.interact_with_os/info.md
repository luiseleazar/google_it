# Using Python to Interact with the Operating Systems

## Operating System

The software that manages everything that goes on in the computer. It reads, writes and deletes files from the hard drive, it handles how the processes start, how they interact with each other and how they eventually finish. It manages how memory gets allocated different processes, how network packets are sent and received and how each programming can access the different hardware components.

## Kernel

The main core of an operating system. It talks directly to the hardware and manages the systems resources.

## User Space

Everything outside of the kernel, like system program and user interface.

## Scalability

When more work is added to a system, system can do whatever it needs to complete the work.

## Absolute path

A full path to the resource in the file system.

    Windows: C:\Users\<user>
    Linux: /home/<user>

## Relative path

Show where the resource path is located in relation to the current working directory.
